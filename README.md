# learning unix

this will be a collection of notes and command listings for learning the unix operating system.  in general an operating system is simply a set of programs that control a computer.  some other operating systems such as microsoft windows and macos are designed for certain types of hardware, however unix runs on almost any kind and if you learn unix you will be able to use many kinds of computers without having to learn an entirely new operating system.

unix does not have a windowing system.
